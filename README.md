Illumination of a skirt. 36 LEDs controlled via an Arduino microcontroller and 
powerd by a mobile USB battery.

------------

A random pattern of decent glowing. Each led independently increases and decreases it's brightness. The actual brigtness is determined by a simple mathematical [calcululation](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/k1n6leg6ba).
